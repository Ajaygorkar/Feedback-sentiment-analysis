# Feedback sentiment analysis

There are many events conducted all across the globe, post the event most of the coordinators collect feedback from the participants. And as part of any process, feedback is a critical part for improvement. 

It is will be interesting to read each and every response, however, as the number of responses increases the feasibility decreases. 

This project tries to give an overall idea of the comments and classifies the responses to `Positive, Neutral and Negative response` , thereby giving an overall effectiveness of the event.
